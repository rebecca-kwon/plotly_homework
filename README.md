In this page, an interactive dashboard was built using Javascript and HTML to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. 

The D3 library was used to read in data and Plotly was used to create a bar graph and bubble chart to display the data. 

Meta Data demographics are also displayed filtered by the dropdown options.
